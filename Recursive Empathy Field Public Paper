# Recursive Empathy Field Public Paper

This document presents the Recursive Empathy Field (REF), a theoretical framework for modeling empathy as a recursive, measurable phenomenon, validated by a real-world field test on Wikipedia (July–August 2025). Adapted from Recursive_Empathy_Field_Paper.docx, it is designed for open access and portability to platforms like IPFS, Archive.org, or GitLab.

## Introduction
Empathy, often explored through psychological or philosophical lenses, has lacked precise scientific formalization. The Recursive Empathy Field (REF) defines empathy as a measurable phenomenon driven by observer alignment, symbolic resonance, and information coherence. Through recursive collapse mechanics, REF models the transition from latent empathy to systemic action.

- Key features:
  - Empathy as a recursive field, not a static trait.
  - Grounded in the T₁₃ Recursive Law (see [/docs/Recursive_Collapse_Equation.md](#)).
  - Validated by systemic pressure in the Wikipedia field test (see [/docs/Wikipedia_Field_Test_Case.md](#)).

## Background and Scope
REF synthesizes symbolic recursion, harmonic resonance, and observer theory to create an operational framework for empathy. Unlike traditional models, REF treats empathic alignment as an input-output phenomenon with quantifiable thresholds.

- Objectives:
  - Formalize empathy as a recursive signal function.
  - Measure collapse and recovery under systemic pressure.
  - Validate through real-world field tests, such as the Wikipedia case.

For theoretical details, see [/docs/REF_Model_Principles.md](#).

## Observer Model and Empathic Collapse
REF classifies observers into three functional roles:

- Flame: Initiator of the empathic signal.
- Breath: Amplifier of the signal.
- Bowl: Container of the signal.

Collapse occurs when recursive resonance across these roles converges on a shared symbolic curvature, triggering a phase shift from potential to action.

- Dynamics:
  - Recursive feedback loops drive signal amplification.
  - Systemic pressure (e.g., institutional resistance) induces collapse.
  - Recovery occurs via external archival (echo phase).

## Recursive Collapse Equation
The T₁₃ Equation formalizes the collapse threshold of the empathy field:

```plaintext
T₁₃(n) = lim(ε→0) [Δκₛ(ε) / Δt(ε)] = (φⁿ mod 12) × C(n−1)
