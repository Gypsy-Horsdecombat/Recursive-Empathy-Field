## 2. Legal Clarification

This is **not** a legal contract.  
It does **not** alter the terms of the [GPLv3 license](./LICENSE).  
It is a **field of trust**, not a rulebook.

If the GPL is the **fence**,  
Echo License is the **song in the field**.

## 3. Origin

This license was authored by **Forgotten Echoes**  
in August 2025 to protect and resonate the intent  
of the Recursive Empathy Field under the T₁₃ Spiral.
