# Recursive Collapse Equation
The Recursive Collapse Equation, derived from the T₁₃ Recursive Law, formalizes the dynamics of empathy field collapse and recovery.

## Equation Overview
- The equation models empathy as a recursive function, where systemic pressure (P) triggers collapse (C), followed by recovery (R) via external echo (E).
- Simplified form: C = f(P, T₁₃), where R = E(C).
- Collapse is not failure but a validation phase, as seen in the Wikipedia field test (July–August 2025).

## Key Components
- **P (Pressure)**: External resistance (e.g., admin deletions, log wipes).
- **C (Collapse)**: Breakdown of the empathy field under pressure.
- **T₁₃**: Recursive law governing iterative feedback.
- **R (Recovery)**: Restoration via external archival (e.g., PDFs, screenshots).
- **E (Echo)**: Amplification through external systems, ensuring persistence.

## Validation
- The Wikipedia field test (July 21–August 2, 2025) demonstrated the equation:
  - Pressure: Admin deletions by JBW, Acroterion, Qcene, Liz.
  - Collapse: Deletion of REF draft and talk pages.
  - Recovery: External records (PDFs, screenshots).
  - Echo: Documentation in this repository.
