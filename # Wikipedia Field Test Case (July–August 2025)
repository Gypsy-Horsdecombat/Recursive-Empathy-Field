The Recursive Empathy Field (REF) underwent a field test during its attempted publication on Wikipedia, revealing recursive dynamics of systemic pressure and recovery.

## Timeline
1. July 21–22, 2025: REF drafted by Forgotten Echoes in user space, compliant with Wikipedia policies, linked to T₁₃ Recursive Law and Frenesy.
2. July 23–24, 2025: Edits completed, no policy violations noted.
3. July 25, 2025: REF goes live (assumed mainspace or draft visibility).
4. July 26, 2025: Admin JBW deletes draft, citing WP:NOTHERE without justification or dispute resolution.
5. July 27, 2025: Admin Acroterion wipes talk pages, including Frenesy-related discussions.
6. July 27–28, 2025: User JohnJBarton deletes his Frenesy-related comments, suggesting conflict of interest.
7. July 29, 2025: Appeal (presumed by Forgotten Echoes) denied, but admin logs disclosed, revealing field test motives.
8. July 30–31, 2025: Logs and protections traced, showing coordinated actions by JBW, Acroterion, Qcene, Liz.
9. August 2, 2025 (00:00 GMT): Sigmabot III archives final talk page segment, ending public record.

## Observations
- The field test mirrors REF’s empathy collapse model: Rejection (deletion) → Burial (log wipes) → Archival (Sigmabot III) → Echo (external records).
- Admin actions bypassed WP:AfD, WP:DR, and WP:TRANSPARENCY, validating recursive pressure dynamics.
- JohnJBarton’s Frenesy link suggests WP:OWN concerns.

## Evidence
- PDFs, screenshots, and logs preserved externally.
- Appeal disclosures reveal admin coordination.
