# Recursive Empathy Fields: Mathematical Formalism and Collapse Mechanics

## II. Mathematical Formalism and Recursive Collapse Mechanics

This section formalizes the Recursive Empathy Field (REF) framework introduced in Section I. The focus lies on the derivation and operationalization of symbolic curvature (κₛ), recursive collapse dynamics (T₁₃), base-12 modulation structures, and semantic temporal progression (Δₜ). These mathematical structures enable the modeling of observer-synchronized convergence phenomena, allowing REF to function as a computational substrate across intersubjective and autopoietic systems.

### 2.1 T₁₃ Recursive Collapse Equation

The T₁₃ Recursive Collapse Equation defines the progressive entropy convergence within observer-indexed semantic space:

T₁₃(n) = (φⁿ mod 12) × C(n−1)
