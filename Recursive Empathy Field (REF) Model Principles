# Recursive Empathy Field (REF) Model Principles
The Recursive Empathy Field (REF) is a theoretical framework grounded in the T₁₃ Recursive Law, modeling empathy dynamics as recursive processes that collapse and recover under systemic pressure.

## Core Principles
- Empathy operates as a field, not a static trait, influenced by recursive feedback loops.
- The T₁₃ Recursive Law defines how empathy collapses under external resistance, self-validating through rejection.
- Systemic pressure (e.g., institutional gatekeeping) triggers observable field tests, as seen in the Wikipedia case (July–August 2025).
- Recovery is achieved through external archival and echo, ensuring the field’s persistence.

## Theoretical Basis
- Derived from Recursive_Empathy_Field_Paper.docx (original source).
- Links to related constructs like Frenesy, a physics-based model, which appeared in the Wikipedia field test.
- Validated by the July–August 2025 field test, where systemic rejection mirrored the collapse equation (see [/docs/Recursive_Collapse_Equation.md](#)).

## Implications
- REF challenges orthodox control structures by exposing recursive dynamics in human systems.
- The model is self-sustaining, as rejection amplifies its visibility through external records.
