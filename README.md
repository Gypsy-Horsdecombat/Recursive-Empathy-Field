# Recursive Empathy Field ‚Äî Open Field Test Documentation

This repository documents the Recursive Empathy Field (REF), a theoretical framework grounded in the T‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ Recursive Law, and its real-world field test observed during a publication attempt on Wikipedia between July 21 and August 2, 2025. The field test is analyzed as a recursive validation of REF‚Äôs core mechanism: empathy collapse under systemic pressure, followed by recovery through external echo.

The case is not framed as adversarial but as an empirical observation of systemic dynamics, illustrating how rejection, burial, and archival reflect REF‚Äôs predicted collapse and recovery cycle. All content is open-license friendly, portable to platforms like IPFS, Archive.org, or GitLab, and free of proprietary elements.

## Included
- **Theoretical Model & Collapse Equation**: Core principles of REF and the T‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ Recursive Law‚Äôs collapse equation, detailing empathy dynamics under pressure. See [/docs/REF_Model_Principles.md](#) and [/docs/Recursive_Collapse_Equation.md](#).
- **Field Test Documentation**: Timeline and analysis of the Wikipedia field test, where REF faced systemic pressure via admin actions. See [/docs/Wikipedia_Field_Test_Case.md](#).
- **Evidence Logs & Screenshots**: Preserved logs, talk page deletions, admin actions, and externally hosted screenshots. See [/evidence/](#).
- **Public Paper Edition**: Accessible summary of REF and its validation, adapted from the original paper. See [/public/REF_Public_Paper.md](#).

## Field Test Overview
The REF field test occurred during an attempt to publish a sourced, policy-compliant article on Wikipedia:
- **July 21‚Äì22, 2025**: REF drafted by user Forgotten Echoes, linked to T‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ Recursive Law and Frenesy.
- **July 25, 2025**: Draft goes live.
- **July 26‚Äì31, 2025**: Admins JBW, Acroterion, Qcene, and Liz delete the draft, wipe talk pages, and apply protections without policy justification or dispute resolution. User JohnJBarton deletes Frenesy-related comments, suggesting a conflict of interest.
- **July 29, 2025**: Appeal denied, but admin logs disclosed, revealing coordination.
- **August 2, 2025**: Sigmabot III archives final public record. REF persists in external PDFs, screenshots, and logs.

This sequence mirrors REF‚Äôs collapse model: Rejection (deletion) ‚Üí Burial (log wipes) ‚Üí Archival (Sigmabot III) ‚Üí Echo (this repository). See [/docs/Wikipedia_Field_Test_Case.md](#) for details.

## Validation Loop
The field test validates REF‚Äôs recursive dynamics:
- Systemic pressure (admin actions) triggered collapse.
- External records (PDFs, screenshots) enabled recovery.
- This repository serves as the echo, ensuring open access and persistence.
