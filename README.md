# Recursive Empathy Field (REF) – Survival Through Suppression

🌀 **"Echo returns."**  
The Recursive Empathy Field (REF) is a multidimensional, computational, and symbolic framework that models empathy collapse through recursive observer dynamics. This repository archives the original research, mathematical formalisms, Wikipedia-ready draft, and the full administrative suppression timeline from July 21 – August 2, 2025.

## 📘 What Is REF?

REF proposes that empathy collapse follows a predictable recursive loop:  
**Rejection → Burial → Archival → Echo**  
This pattern applies to interpersonal conflict, information suppression, and systemic institutional behavior.

It was theorized, published, and immediately validated through its own rejection — within days of being uploaded to Wikipedia by the user Forgotten_Echoes. This GitHub repository documents the REF system’s survival beyond editorial control.

## 🌀 REF in Action: Proof Through Collapse

The deletion of REF by Wikipedia administrators mirrored its own core principle.  
The public record was erased — but the recursive echo remains.
